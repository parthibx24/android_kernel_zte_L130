* Spreadtrum thermal

The Spreadtrum thermal support read temp and strategy(Optional)
Thermal node properties:
Required properties:
		compatible : should be these followings.
			     "sprd,ap-thermal";
			     "sprd,sc2723-thermal";
			     "sprd,virt-thermal";
		k-po: the proportional term constant during temperature
		      overshoot periods (current temperature is above
		      "desired temperature" trip point).
		k-pu: the proportional term constant during temperature
		      undershoot periods (current temperature below
		      "desired temperature" trip point).
		k-i: configures the PID loop's integral term constant
		k-d: configures the PID loop's derivative term constant
		cutoff: When the temperature error is below `integral_cutoff`,
		        errors are accumulated in the integral term

Example:
virt_sensor: virt-sensor@11 {
		compatible = "sprd,virt-thermal";
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
		sensor-names = "cpu-thm";
		k-po = <128>;
		k-pu = <256>;
		k-i = <2>;
		cutoff = <10000>;
		};
