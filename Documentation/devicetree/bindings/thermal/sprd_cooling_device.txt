Spreadtrum cooling device

The Spreadtrum cooling devices can be bound to thermal zone trip points.
When a trip point reached, the bound cpufreq cooling device turns active
to set CPU frequency low to cool down the CPU.

Required properties:
- compatible :    Should be "sprd,cpu-cooling"
- policy : 	  used to describe cooling devices thermal policy,
		  set IPA if policy filled,
		  other policy if it is empty
- sprd,efuse-block :
		  Efuse block number is used to indicate that in order to
		  get thermal information which efuse block should read.
- #cooling-cells: Used to provide cooling device specific information
		  while referring to it. Must be at least 2, in order
		  to specify minimum and maximum cooling state used
		  in the reference. The first cell is the minimum
		  cooling state requested and the second cell is
		  the maximum cooling state requested in the reference.
		  See Cooling device maps section below for more details
		  on how consumers refer to cooling devices.
Optional properties:
- sprd,leak-core: coefficient of core leakage power.
- sprd,leak-cluster:
		  coefficient of cluster leakage power.
- sprd,temp-scale:For temperature scale calculation.
- sprd,volt-scale:For voltage scale calculation.
- sprd,hotplug-period:
		  Periods to wait before hotplugging CPUs.
- sprd,core-base:
		  base of core leakage power.
- sprd,cluster-base:
		  base of cluster leakage power.
- sprd,dynamic-core:
		  coefficient of core dynamic power.
- sprd,dynamic-cluster:
		  coefficient of cluster dynamic power.

Example:

cooling-devices {
	policy = "ipa";
	cooling_device0: cooling-device0 {
		compatible = "sprd,cpu-cooling";
		#cooling-cells = <2>; /* min followed by max */
		sprd,efuse-block = <7>;
		sprd,leak-core = <2 85 1869>;
	};
	cooling_device1: cooling-device1 {
		compatible = "sprd,cpu-cooling";
		#cooling-cells = <2>; /* min followed by max */
		sprd,efuse-block = <7>;
		sprd,temp-scale = <825 (-117000) 6080000 (-81850000)>;
	};
};
