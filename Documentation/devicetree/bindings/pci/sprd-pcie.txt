Spreadtrum PCIe host bridge DT description

Spreadtrum PCIe host controller is based on Designware PCI core.
It shares common functions with PCIe Designware core driver and inherits
common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pci.txt.

Additional properties are described here:

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "sprd,pcie".
- reg: Should contain dbi, config registers location and length.
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  "dbi": controller configuration registers;
  "config": PCIe configuration space registers.

Optional properties:
- status: Either "ok" or "disabled".

Example:
	pcie0@20c00000 {
		compatible = "sprd,pcie", "snps,dw-pcie";
		reg = <0x0 0x20c00000 0x0 0x100000>,
		      <0x3 0xffffe000 0x0 0x2000>;
		reg-names = "dbi", "config";
		#address-cells = <3>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		device_type = "pci";
		ranges = <0x43000000 0x0 0x00000000 0x2 0x80000000 0x1 0x77f00000>;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 148 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		bus-range = <0  15>;
		num-lanes = <1>;
		num-vectors = <256>;
		num-viewport = <8>;
		status = "okay";
	};
