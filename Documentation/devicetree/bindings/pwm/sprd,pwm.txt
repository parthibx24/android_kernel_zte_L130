*Spreadtrum SoCs based PWM Subsystem
=============================================

Spreadtrum SoCs contain PWM controller which can be used for system clock
event timers,as well as to drvier SoC output wiht PWM signal.Each controller
provides 4 PWM channels.

Required porperties:
- compatible : "sprd,pwm"

- reg: base address and size of register area

- clock-names: should contain all following required clock names:
        - "sprd_pwm_clk_parent" - parent clock for pwm clock,
        - "clk_pwm" - pwm base clock used to generate PWM signals.

- clocks: phandle of the clock used by the PWM module.

See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of the cells format.
More information refer to <Documention/devicetree/bindings/pwm.txt>.

Optional properties:
- None

Example:
        pwms: pwm@40260000{
                compatible = "sprd,pwm";
                reg = <0x40260000 0x10000>;
                clock-names = "sprd_pwm_clk_parent", "clk_pwm";
                clocks = <&ext_26m>, <&clk_pwm2>;
                #pwm-cells = <2>;
        }
