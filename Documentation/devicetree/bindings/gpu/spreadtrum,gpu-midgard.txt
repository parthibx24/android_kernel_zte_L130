* ARM Mali-T720 GPU
* It has common properties with mali-utgard, as described in spreadtrum,gpu.txt.

Required properties:
    - compatible : "sprd,mali-midgard" for mali T720 IP present in SC9838 etc. SoC

    - operating-points : It's the DVFS optional frequence range of GPU which depends on Linux Kernel. example:
        153600 means the clock source frequence is 153600 kHz,
        0  is current voltage.

Example:
	gpu@60000000 {
		compatible = "arm,mali-midgard";
		...

		operating-points = <
			/* kHz   uV */
			512000   0
			384000   0
			256000   0
			153600   0

Required properties:
    - compatible : "sprd,mali-midgard" for mali T820 IP present in sc9850j etc. SoC

    - system-coherency : Selecting the coherency mode of the platform is done through device tree. The following modes are supported for cci400:
	0  : ACE-Lite
	31 : no coherency

Example:
	gpu@60000000 {
		compatible = "arm64,mali-midgard";
		...

		system-coherency = <31>;
	};
