* ARM Mali-300/400/450 GPU
* It has common properties with mali-midgartd, as decribed in spradtrum,gpu.txt.

Required properties:
    - compatible : "arm,mali-400" "sprd,mali-utgard" for mali 400 IP present in SC9830 etc. SoC

Optional properties:
    - pmu_domain_config:
        - If the Mali internal PMU is present and the PMU IRQ is specified in
            interrupt/interrupt-names ("IRQPMU").This contains the mapping of
            Mali HW units to the PMU power domain.
        -Mali Dynamic power domain configuration in sequence from 0-11, like:
            <GP PP0 PP1 PP2 PP3  PP4 PP5 PP6 PP7 L2$0 L2$1 L2$2>.

    - pmu-switch-delay:
        - Only needed if the power gates are connected to the PMU in a high fanout
            network. This value is the number of Mali clock cycles it takes to
            enable the power gates and turn on the power mesh. This value will
            have no effect if a daisy chain implementation is used.

Example:
	gpu@60000000 {
		compatible = "arm,mali-400", "arm,mali-utgard";
		...

		pmu_domain_config = <0x1000 0x1000 0x1000
			0x0 0x0 0x0
			0x0 0x0 0x0
			0x1000 0x0 0x0>;
		pmu_switch_delay = <0xffff>;

		...
	};
