* Spreadtrum  GPU HW Accelerator Common Properties

Required properties:
  - compatible : For more details, please refer to utgard, midgard and rogue

  - reg : Physical base address and length of the GPU's registers.

  - sprd,syscon-pmu-apb : PMU-APB bus node, used to get GPU status.

  - interrupts:
        List of all Mali interrupts.
        This list must match the number of and the order of entries in interrupt-names.

  - interrupt-names:
        - IRQPP<X> - Name for PP interrupts.
        - IRQPPMMU<X> -  Name for interrupts from the PP MMU.
        - IRQPP - Name for the PP broadcast interrupt (Mali-450 only).
        - IRQGP - Name for the GP interrupt.
        - IRQGPMMU - Name for the interrupt from the GP MMU.
        - IRQPMU - Name for the PMU interrupt (If pmu is implemented in HW, it must be contained).

  - clocks : Should not be changed, it's set according to the chip design.

    Note : these below "sprd,dfs-xxx" configurations are sprd private, should not be arbitrarily modified.

  - sprd,dfs-lists : It's the DFS optional frequence range of GPU, example:
    <153600 2 1> means the clock source frequence is 153600 kHz,
                2 is an index of gpu parent clocks array that descripted in chipset spec,
                1 is divisor of this clock source, it only can be changed according to the spec.

  - sprd,dfs-default : The default frequence of GPU. The number is the index of sprd,dfs-lists.

  - sprd,dfs-scene-extreme : It means these scene that need extreme high performance,
                             GPU should run at the chosen frequence.

  - sprd,dfs-scene-high : It means these scene that need high performance,
                             GPU should run at the chosen frequence.

  - sprd,dfs-scene-medium: It means these scene that need medium performance,
                             GPU should run at the chosen frequence.

  - sprd,dfs-scene-low: It means these scene that need to save power,
                             GPU should run at the chosen frequence.

  - sprd,dfs-range-max : DFS max range, the number is the index of sprd,dfs-lists.

  - sprd,dfs-range-min : DFS min range, the number is the index of sprd,dfs-lists.
