* The sprd sdio power sequence provider

The purpose of the driver provider is to supports sprd wcn chip

Required properties:
- compatible : contains "mmc-pwrseq-sprd-sdio".

Optional properties:
- rstn-gpios : contains a list of GPIO specifiers. The reset GPIOs are asserted
	at initialization and prior we start the power up procedure of the card.
	They will be de-asserted right after the power has been provided to the
	card.
- chip-en-gpios The chip-en GPIOs are asserted when power up chip.
- clocks : Must contain an entry for the entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entry:
  "ext_clock" (External clock provided to the card).

Example:
	sdio_pwrseq: sdio-pwrseq {
		compatible = "mmc-pwrseq-sprd-sdio";
		rstn-gpios = <&ap_gpio 111 0>;
		chip-en-gpios = <&ap_gpio 112 0>;
		clock-names = "clk_32k","source","enable";
		clocks = <&clk_aux0>,<&ext_32k>,
			 <&clk_aon_apb_gates1 2>;
		post-power-on-delay-ms = <20>;
	};
