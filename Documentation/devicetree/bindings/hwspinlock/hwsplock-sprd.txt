Spreadtrum hardware spinlock controller binding

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "sprd,hwspinlock-r2p0", it's similar to that on sc9838 SoC family.
- reg: Offset and length of hardware spinlock controller register space.
- hwlocks-base: Assign a base id to register the hwspinlock controller.
- hwlocks-num: The number of the hardware spinlock.
- resets: The resets property is related to reset source.
- reset-names: Its purpose is to constrain resets property.
- clock-names: Clock-names should be "enable" specified in hwspinlock driver.
	       Its purpose is to constrain clocks property.
- clocks: The freq of apb clk connected to hwspinlock module.
- sprd,axi-id: Setting this property to make HWSPINLCOK record AXI ID. If no,
	       the HWSPINLOCK will record the USERID as default.

Example:
	hwslock1: hwspinlock@40060000{
		compatible  = "sprd,hwspinlock-r2p0";
		reg = <0 0x40060000 0 0x1000>;
		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
		hwlocks-base = <0>;
		hwlocks-num = <32>;
		resets = <&aon_rst 24>;
		reset-names = "hwspinlock1";
		clock-names = "enable";
		clocks = <&clk_aon_apb_gates0 22>;
	};
