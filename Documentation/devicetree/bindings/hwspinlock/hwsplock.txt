Hardware spinlock controller binding

* Hardware spinlock controller

Required property:
- #hwlock-cells: Must be at least 1. Used to provide hardware lock controller specific information.
- hwlocks-base: Specify the hwlocks base id of this controller to register into the hwlocks radix tree.

Optional properties:
- hwlocks-num: Number of hardware spinlock supported by the controller.

Example:
	hwslock0: hwlocks@20c00000{
		compatible  = "sprd,sc9838-hwspinlock";
		reg = <0 0x20c00000 0 0x1000>;
		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
		hwlocks-base = <32>;
		hwlocks-num = <32>;
	};

* Users of hardware spinlock

The users' driver should specify the hardware spinlock property using a phandle.

Required property:
- hwlocks: Each consisting of
	- A phandle pointing to hardware spinlock controller node.
	- A number of integer cells, as determined by the #hwlock-cells
	property in the node referenced by phandle containing hardware
	spinlock controller specific information. This typically contains
	a hardware spinlock id, but can contain any data that is required
	for configuring a hardware spinlock.
- hwlock-names: Contains one identifier string for each hardware spinlock in
	the hwlocks property. The specific strings that can be used are defined
	in the binding of the client device.

Examples:
	adc@1 {
		...
		hwlocks = <&hwslock0 2 &hwslock0 3>;
		hwlocks-names = "lock0", "lock1";
		...
	};
