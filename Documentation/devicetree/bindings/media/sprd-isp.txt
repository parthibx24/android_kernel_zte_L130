* Spreadtrum ISP

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "sprd,isp-r1p0".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: isp interrupt specifier.
- clocks: The freq of source clk connected to isp.
- clock-names: List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
  order as the clocks property.  Consumers drivers will use clock-names to
  match clock input names with clocks specifiers.
- sprd,sys-mm-ahb: mm-ahb bus node, used to get isp status

Optional properties:
-

Examples:
         isp: isp@60a00000 {
             compatible  = "sprd,isp-r1p0";
             reg = <0x60a00000 0x100000>;
             interrupts = <GIC_SPI 44 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
             clocks = <&clk_aon_apb_gates0 25>,<&clk_isp>,<&clk_twpll_307m2>,
                 <&clk_mm_axi_gate 4>, <&clk_mm_ahb_gate 2>;
             clock-names = "clk_mm_i","clk_isp","clk_isp_parent",
                 "isp_axi_eb","isp_eb";
             sprd,sys-mm-ahb = <&mm_ahb_controller>;
         };
