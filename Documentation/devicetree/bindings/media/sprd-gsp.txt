* Spreadtrum Graphic Signal Processor

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of the follows:
              "sprd,gsp-core", for gsp with only one core,such as sc9830, sc9832;
              "sprd,gsp-core0", for a core of gsp is the first one,such as spwhale;
              "sprd,gsp-core1", for a core of gsp is the second one,such as spwhale;
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped region.
- core-id: the core number.
- kcfg-num: indicate how many kcfgs this core possess.
- real-time: figure out whether core kthread priority is real-time.
- map-64-bit: indicate whether gsp core must need iommu because of 64-bit environment 
- interrupts: gsp interrupt specifier.
- sprd,syscon-ap-ahb: ap-ahb bus node, used to get gsp status
- sprd,syscon-aon-apb: AON-APB bus node, used to get gsp status
- clock-names: List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
		order as the clocks property.  Consumers drivers
		will use clock-names to match clock input names
		with clocks specifiers.
- clocks: The freq of source clk connected to gsp.


Optional properties:

			gsp_core0: gsp@20a00000 {
				compatible = "sprd,gsp-core";
				reg = <0x20a00000 0x1000>;
				core-id = <0>;
				kcfg-num = <8>;
				real-time;
				map-to-64bit;
				interrupts = <GIC_SPI 51 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
				iommus = <&iommu_gsp>;
				sprd,sys-ap-ahb = <&ap_ahb_controller>;
				sprd,sys-aon-apb = <&aon_apb_controller>;
				clock-names = "clk_gsp",
						   "clk_gsp_parent",

						   "clk_gsp_eb";
				clocks = <&clk_gsp>,
						<&clk_twpll_256m>,
						<&clk_aon_apb_gate1 13>,
						<&clk_ap_ahb_gates 3>;
