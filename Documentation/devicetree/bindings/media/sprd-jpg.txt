* Spreadtrum JPEG compress and decompress Processing Engine

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "sprd,jpg".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: JPG interrupt specifier.
- sprd,syscon-aon-apb: AON-APB bus node, used to get JPG status
- sprd,syscon-mm-ahb: mm-ahb bus node, used to get JPG status
- clock-names:	List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
		order as the clocks property.  Consumers drivers
		will use clock-names to match clock input names
		with clocks specifiers.
- clocks: The freq of source clk connected to JPG.


Optional properties:
-

Examples:
	jpg: jpeg-codec@0x60b00000{
                compatible = "sprd,jpg";
                reg = <0 0x60b00000 0 0x8000>;
                interrupts = <0 42 0x0>;
		sprd,syscon-aon-apb = <&aon_apb_controller>;
		sprd,syscon-mm-ahb = <&mm_ahb_controller>;
                clock-names = "clk_mm_i","clk_jpg";
                clocks = <&clk_aon_apb_gates0 25>, <&clk_jpg>;
            };
