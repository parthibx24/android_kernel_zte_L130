* Spreadtrum Video Signal Processing Engine

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of the follows:
              "sprd,sharkl-vsp", for sharkl series of chips,such as sc9830, sc9832;
              "sprd,sharklt8-vsp", for sharklt8 series of chips,such as sc9838;
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: VSP interrupt specifier.
- sprd,syscon-aon-apb: AON-APB bus node, used to get VSP status
- sprd,syscon-mm-ahb: mm-ahb bus node, used to get VSP status
- clock-names: List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
		order as the clocks property.  Consumers drivers
		will use clock-names to match clock input names
		with clocks specifiers.
- clocks: The freq of source clk connected to VSP.


Optional properties:
-

Examples:
        vsp: video-codec@60900000{
			compatible = "sprd,sharkl-vsp";
			reg = <0x60900000 0xc000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 43 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			sprd,syscon-aon-apb = <&aon_apb_controller>;
			sprd,syscon-mm-ahb = <&mm_ahb_controller>;
			clock-names = "clk_mm_i", "clk_vsp", "clk_mm_axi";
			clocks = <&clk_aon_apb_gates0 25>, <&clk_vsp>, <&clk_mm_ahb>;
		};
