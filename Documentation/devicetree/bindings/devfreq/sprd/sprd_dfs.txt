* Spreadtrum DDR DFS device

The Spreadtrum DDR DFS device provides an interface to DFS core(cm4 or ARM&). 
This file documents the properties used by the Spreadtrum DDR DFS devic

Required properties:
- compatible:
 should be "sprd,dfs" for sharkl2/isharkl2/iwhale2/sharklj1/sharkle
 "sprd,dfs_auto" for sharkl3 and later chips.
- freq-num: frequency number can set by kernel.
- sprd-scene: scene name which set by userspace.
- sprd-freq: frequency for every sprd-scene.


Optional properties:
- overflow: the bandwith when frequency up to next level
- underflow: the bandwith when frequency down to previous level

Example:

         scene-frequency {
                 compatible = "sprd,dfs_auto";
                 freq-num = <8>;
                sprd-scene = "boost", "lcdon", "lcdoff", "camlow",
                        "camhigh";
                sprd-freq = <933 311 233 533 933>;
