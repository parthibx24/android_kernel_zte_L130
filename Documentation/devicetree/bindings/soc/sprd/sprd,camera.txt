Spreadtrum camera bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
	"sprd,dcam-r3p0"
	"sprd,cpp"
	"sprd,csi-controller"
	"sprd,mipi-csi-phy"
	"sprd,sprd_scale"
	"sprd,sprd_rotation"
- reg: address range of dcam-r3p0 device.
- interrupters: interrupt number used for dcam r3p0.
- clocks: dcam r3p0 related clocks.
- clock-names: dcam r3p0 related clock names.
- sprd,isp: isp is a attribute of dcam r3p0.
- sprd,dcam-count: dcam r3p0 device contains channel number.

Example:

dcam: dcam@60800000 {
        compatible = "sprd,dcam-r3p0";
        reg = <0x60800000 0x1000>;
        interrupters = <GIC_SPI 45 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        clocks = <&clk_ahb_mm_gates 0>, <&clk_aon_apb_gates0 25>;
        clock-names = "dcam_eb", "clk_mm_eb";
        sprd,isp = <&isp>;
        sprd,dcam-count = <1>;
        status = "disable";
    };
