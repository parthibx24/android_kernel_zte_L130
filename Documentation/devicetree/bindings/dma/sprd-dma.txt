Spreadtrum DMA Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "sprd,ap-dma-v1.0".
	There are different DMA IP versions for different Spreadtrum SoC families.
	So we use specified IP to compatible different SoC.
	e.g. ap-dma-v0.0(sharkl);aon-dma-v0.0(sharkl);ap-dma-v1.0(whale);agcp-dma-v1.0(whale);
	ap-dma-v2.0(whale2);agcp-dma-v2.0(whale2).
	Required properties:
	compatible: should be one of following:
		"sprd,ap-dma-v0.0" - compatible with ports present on sharkl SoC,
		"sprd,aon-dma-v0.0" - compatible with ports present on sharkl SoC,
		"sprd,ap-dma-v1.0" - compatible with ports present on whale SoC,
		"sprd,agcp-dma-v1.0" - compatible with ports present on whale SoC,
		"sprd,ap-dma-v2.0" - compatible with ports present on whale2 SoC,
		"sprd,agcp-dma-v2.0" - compatible with ports present on whale2 SoC.
- reg: Address range of the DMAC registers.
- dma-channels: Number of channels supported by hardware.
- #dma-cells: must be <1>.
- sprd,aon-offset: The AON dma controller channel number offset.
- sprd,full-type-offset: The full type channel number offset for AP/AGCP or AON dma.
- sprd,syscon-dma-glb: DMA glb reg base.
- clock-names: DMA clock enable/disabe name.
- clocks: DMA clock enable/disable bit.

Optional properties:
- interrupt: Should contain the DMAC interrupt number.
	There are some DMAC do not need to request interrupts, because these interrupts
	could be handled by others subsys.

Example:

	dma: dma-controller@20100000 {
		compatible = "sprd,ap-dma-v1.0";
		reg = <0 0x20100000 0 0x4000>,	/* ap reg */
		      <0 0x40100000 0 0x4000>;	/* aon reg */
		interrupts = <0 50 0x0>,		/* ap int */
			     <0 70 0x0>;		/* aon int */
		#dma-channels = <64>;
		#dma-cells = <1>;
		sprd,aon-offset = <33>;
		sprd,full-type-offset = <25 25>;	/* ap & aon */
		sprd,syscon-dma-glb = <&ap_ahb_controller>;
		clock-names = "enable";
		clocks = <&clk_ap_ahb_gates 5>;

	};

DMA clients must use the format described in the dma.txt file, using a two cell
specifier for each channel.

Example:

	uart0: serial@70000000 {
		compatible = "sprd,sc9836-uart",
			     "sprd,sc9838-uart";
		reg = <0 0x70000000 0 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 2 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&ext_26m>;
		status = "disabled";
		dmas = <&dma 0>,
		       <&dma 1>;
		dma-names = "rx", "tx";
	};
