Spreadtrum Communications SC2705 Haptics bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: "sprd,sc2705-haptics"
- reg:  I2C slave address
- interrupts: haptic events report.
- pwms : phandle to the physical PWM(Pulse Width Modulation) device.
	PWM properties should be named "pwms". And number of cell is different
	for each pwm device.
	To get more information, please refer to documentation.
	[*] refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
- sprd,vib-mode:
	"LRA_MODE" - Linear Resonance Actuator mode
	"ERM_BAR" - Bar type Eccentric Rotating Mass mode
	"ERM_COIN" - Coin type Eccentric Rotating Mass mode
- sprd,play-mode: choose one in below five modes
	"DRO-MODE" - Direct register override mode
	"PWM-MODE" - PWM based playback mode
	"WAVEFORM-Reg-trig" - Waveform + register triggered mode
	"WAVEFORM-Rising-trig" - Waveform + rising edge triggered mode
	"WAVEFORM-dual-trig" - Waveform + dual edge triggered mode

	In case of WAVEFORM mode, user can choose one of below options.
	1. Fix PS_SEQ_LOOP (0~15), send value(PS_SEQ_ID) to driver.
		please use below optional property 'sprd,seq-loop'
	2. Send value to driver. the value consist of
		PS_SEQ_LOOP(4Bits[7:4]) & PS_SEQ_ID(4Bits[3:0])
		For example, if PS_SEQ_LOOP = 8, PS_SEQ_ID = 8,
			then it must be 0x88.

	In case of WAVEFORM-rising-trig and dual-trig mode,
	User have to enable haptic first then, must handle PWM or GPIO input.
	- rising edge edge mode:
		whenever external input is up to high, it will start to play
		but if it goes low->high during playback is on going,
		it will stop.
	- dual edge edge mode:
		external input is up to high, it will start to play
		external input is down to low, it will stop

- sprd,nom-volt-rating: nominal drive voltage rating, default 2500mV
- sprd,abs-max-volt: Absolute max voltage rating , default 2800mV
- sprd,current-rate: Actuator current rating, default 250mA
- sprd,impedance-ohms: Actuator impedance, please apply below formula(average)
	 in case of coin type ERM, otherwise just apply its own ohms.
	A Coin ERM(datasheet) may show Impedance = 33/66 Ohms then,
	impedance-ohms = 44 = 2/3*(Low val = 33) + 1/3*(High val = 66)
- sprd,filter-res-trim: Actuator impedance related threshold(MIN/MAX, 0~3)
	How to calculate:
	B1 = sprd,impedance-ohms(above, user input)
	B2 = Actuator_inductance_Henry(user input)
	* B3, filter-res-trim: MIN = 0, MAX = 3
	B3 = 3+ROUNDDOWN(LOG10(12.2/B1)/LOG10(1.5))
	B4 = B2/(B1*(60E-12*(1.5^(B3-3))-6E-12)*350E3)
	sprd,filter-res-trim = 3+ROUNDDOWN(LOG10(B4)/LOG10(2.15)-0.5)
	For example,
	sprd,filter-res-trim = 3, for (B1 = 3(Ohms), B2 = 0.0001(H))

Optional properties:
- sprd,resonant-freq: use in case of LRA_MODE, default 205Hz.
		the freq range: 50Hz ~ 300Hz.
		It will be set to 205Hz if the value is out of range.
- sprd,seq-loop: use if want to fix seq-loop(0~15).
- sprd,mem-array: use in case that memory registers should be updated,
		Please fill the whole buffer(90 values) to avoid any error in driver.
		If pattern size is 80, then fill the rest(10) of array to '0' as below.
		For example,
		sprd,mem-array = <
			0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
			10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
			20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
			30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
			40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
			50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59
			60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69
			70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79
