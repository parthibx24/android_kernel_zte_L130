Spreadtrum General Purpose Timer bindings

Required properties:
- compatible : this property should be set to one of the following:
	"sprd,gp-timer" (default compatible string)
	"sprd,evt-r3p0" (applicable to soc using sprd r3p0 ip as clockevent
			and clocksource)
	"sprd,bcevt-r3p0" (applicable to soc using sprd r3p0 IP as broadcast
			clockevent)
	"sprd,evt-r4p0" (applicable to soc using sprd r4p0 ip as clockevent
			and clocksource)
	"sprd,bcevt-r4p0" (applicable to soc using sprd r4p0 IP as broadcast
			clockevent)
	"sprd,aon-systimer" (default to aon system timer node)
	"sprd,ap-systimer" (default to ap system timer node)

- reg : Contains timer register address range (base address and length).

- clock-frequency : The frequency of the general purpose timer in Hz.

Optional properties:
- interrupts : Contains the interrupt information for the timer. The
  format is being dependent on interrupt parent controller.

- sprd,evtlist : Contains the timer used as clockevent timer for each cpu.

- sprd,clksrc : Contains the timer used as the clocksource counter.

Example:

sprd_evt_r3p0 {
	compatible  = "sprd,evt-r3p0";
	sprd,evtlist = <&aon_timer0
				&apt0_timer0 &apt1_timer0 &apt2_timer0>;
	sprd,clksrc = <&aon_timer1>;
};

aon_timer0: timer@40050000 {
	reg =   <0 0x40050000 0 0x14>;
	compatible = "sprd,bcevt-r3p0";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 28 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-frequency = <32768>;
};

aon_timer0: timer@40050000 {
	reg =   <0 0x40050000 0 0x14>;
	compatible = "sprd,bcevt-r4p0";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 28 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-frequency = <32768>;
};
