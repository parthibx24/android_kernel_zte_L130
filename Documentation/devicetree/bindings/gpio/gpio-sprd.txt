* SPREADTRUM GPIO controller bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: "sprd,ap-eic".
  where <chip> is digital(sc9838) or analog(sc2723t),
  eic is a gpi with the capability to latch a signal or debounce a signal,
  gpio did not have the capability.
- reg: Should contain GPIO controller registers location and length
- interrupts: Should be the port interrupt shared by all the gpios.
- #gpio-cells: Should be two.  The first cell is the gpio number and
  the second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently
  unused).
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- sprd,gpiobase: identifies the first GPIO number handled by the chip.
- sprd,ngpios: the number of GPIOs handld by the controller.


Example:
	ap_eic: gpio-controller@40210000 {
		compatible = "sprd,ap-eic";
		reg = <0 0x40210000 0 0x1000>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		sprd,gpiobase = <288>;/*TODO:Need to be changed when pinctrl driver is ready*/
		sprd,ngpios = <16>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 37 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};
