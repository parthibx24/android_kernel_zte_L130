* SPREADTRUM Real Time Clock controller bindings

This binding supports the following chip: sc2723t

Required properties:
- compatible: should be: "sprd,sc2723t-rtc",
- reg: physical base address offset of the controller
- interrupt-parent: rtc alarm parent's interrupt
- interrupts: rtc alarm interrupt

Example:

rtc@80 {
	compatible = "sprd,sc2723t-rtc";
	interrupt-parent = <&pmic_intc>;
	interrupts = <2>;
	reg = <0x80>;
};
