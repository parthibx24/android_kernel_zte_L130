Sansa crypto engine driver

Required properties:

- compatible  : should be "dx,cc63p"
- reg         : specifies base physical address and size of the registers map
- interrupts  : interrupt number
- clock-names : list of device clock input names; should contain one entry
		"enable"
- clocks      : list of clock phandle and specifier pairs for all clocks
		listed in clock-names property
- status      : Should be "okay" or "disabled" for enabled/disabled.

Example:
	crypto@50100000 {
		compatible = "dx,cc63p";
		reg = <0x50100000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 21 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clock-names = "enable";
		clocks = <&clk_ap_ahb_gates 11>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
