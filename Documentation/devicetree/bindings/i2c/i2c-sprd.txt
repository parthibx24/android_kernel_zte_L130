I2C for Spreadtrum platforms

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "sprd,r7p0-i2c".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: Should contain I2C interrupt.
- clock-names:	The i2C for spreadtrum clock-names should contain i2c
		clock node, source clk node ,i2c module enable clock node.
		Clock-names is fixed in i2c drivers, and its purpose is to
		constrain the order of clocks property.Consumers drivers
		will use clock-names to match clock input names with clocks
		specifiers.
- clocks: The freq of source clk connected to i2c.List of clock input name
	  strings sorted in the same order as the clocks property.
- clock-frequency: The property is communication frequency of i2c controller
- #address-cells: Should be <1> address cells for i2c device address
- #size-cells: Should be <0> as i2c addresses have no size component

Optional properties:
- Child nodes conforming to i2c bus binding

Examples:
i2c0: i2c@70500000 {
	compatible = "sprd,r7p0-i2c";
	reg = <0 0x70500000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-names = "i2c", "source","enable";
	clocks = <&clk_i2c3>, <&ext_26m>,
		<&clk_ap_apb_gates 11>;
	clock-frequency = <400000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
};
