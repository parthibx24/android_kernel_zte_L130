* Spreadtrum Nand Host Controller

The Spreadtrum Nand Host Controller provides an interface for Nand.
This file documents differences between the coreproperties described by Nand.txt
and the properties used by the Spreadtrum Nand driver.

Required properties:
- compatible:
 should be "sprd,nandc-r5"
 in order to compatible with Nand controller version
- reg: Registers location and length
- interrupts: exactly one interrupt specifier
- clock-frequency: Base freq of nand controller
- clocks: Freq of source clk of nand controller ECC and ahb enable or disable
Example:

nandc: nandc@21a00000 {
	compatible = "sprd,nandc-r5";
	reg = <0x21a00000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 59 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-frequency = <192000000>;
	clocks = <&clk_nandc_2x>,<&clk_nandc_ecc>,
		 <&clk_rpll_195m>,<&ext_26m>,
		 <&clk_ap_ahb_gates 10>;
	status = "disabled";
};
