Spreadtrum leds driver bindings
Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the leds device.
Each node's name represents the name of the corresponding LED.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of
	"sprd,sc2723t-bltc-rgb"
	"sprd,sc2731-bltc-rgb"
	"sprd,sc2721-bltc-rgb"
	"sprd,sc2720-bltc-rgb"

- reg: the chip addr offset

Example:

pmic_bltc_rgb: bltc-rgb@180 {
	compatible = "sprd,sc2720-bltc-rgb";
	reg = <0x180>;
	status = "disabled";
};
