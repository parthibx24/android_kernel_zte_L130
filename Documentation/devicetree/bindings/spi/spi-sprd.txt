SPI for Spreadtrum platforms

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "sprd,spi-r4p0".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: Should contain SPI interrupt
- clock-names: The clock-names must have "spi", "source" and "enable".
	       Clock-names is fixed in SPI driver, and the property order
	       of clocks is according to it. SPI drivers will use clock-names
	       to match clock input names with clocks specifiers.
- clocks: The freq of source clk connected to SPI. List of clock input name
	  strings sorted in the same order as the clocks property.
- #address-cells: number of cells required to define a chip select
		  address on the SPI bus.Should be set to 1.
- #size-cells: Should be set to 0.


Example:
spi0: spi@70a00000{
	compatible = "sprd,spi-r4p0";
	reg = <0 0x70a00000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-names = "spi", "source","enable";
	clocks = <&clk_spi0>,<&ext_26m>,
		<&clk_ap_apb_gates 5>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	status = "disabled";
};
