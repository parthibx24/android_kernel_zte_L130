Spreadtrum AP SoC interrupt controllers

Each Spreadtrum AP SoC contains 5 custom interrupt controllers which are used
to extend the ARM gic. When system is in the low power state, we can select and
enable the corresponding interrupt source by configuring these custom interrupt
controllers to wake up the system.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of follows:
	-"sprd,sc7731-extn-intc" for soc sc7731
	-"sprd,sc9836-extn-intc" for soc sc9836
	-"sprd,sc9838-extn-intc" for soc sc9838
- reg: Physical base address(es) of interrupt registers length of memory mapped
  region.
  index 0 : the base address of sprd intc0
  index 1 : the base address of sprd intc1
  index 2 : the base address of sprd intc2
  index 3 : the base address of sprd intc3
  index 4 : the base address of sprd aon intc
- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.

Example:
	ap_gic_extn: interrupt-controller@71400000 {
		compatible = "sprd,sc9838-extn-intc";
		interrupt-controller;
		reg =   <0 0x71400000 0 0x1000>,
			<0 0x71500000 0 0x1000>,
			<0 0x71600000 0 0x1000>,
			<0 0x71700000 0 0x1000>,
			<0 0x40200000 0 0x1000>;
	}
