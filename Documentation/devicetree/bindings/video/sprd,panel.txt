Spreadtrum Generic Panel Binding file
-------------------------------------
In Spreadtrum Board Configurations, Generic LCD Panel framework
supports multiple LCD panels integration, dynamically at runtime.
Each LCD panel have its specific DTSI file.

The panel data, that is common to all LCD panels,
should be specified under LCD panel node exist in Board file(DTS).

Panel driver read panel's data from their respective DT nodes
defined in their DTSI files and communicate(send/receive data)
with Panel. Panel node, corresponding to which communication succeed,
is set and attach with SOC.

-------------------
Required Properties
-------------------

-compatible	:
		"sprd,lcd-mipi-panel" - for mipi panel driver
		"sprd,lcd-lvds-panel" - for lvds panel driver
		"sprd,lcd-rgb-panel" - for rgb panel driver
		"sprd,lcd-mcu-panel" - for mcu panel driver

-vlcdio-supply	: LCD I/O power supply regulators
-vlcdcore-supply: LCD core power supply regulators
-sprd,lcd-panels: Phandle list of LCD panels nodes
		(contains panel configuration data).

---------------
Required Nodes
---------------

-port :
-remote-endpoint : remote end point of panel node, through
		which panel communicates(send/receive) with DISPC or DSI.

Example:
--------
lcd0: panel@0 {
	compatible	= "sprd,lcd-mipi-panel";

	vlcdio-supply	= <&vdd28>;
	vlcdcore-supply	= <&vdd18>;
	sprd,lcd-panels	= <&lcd_ssd2075_mipi>,<&lcd_hx8394a_mipi>;

	port {
		panel_in: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&dsi0_out>;
		};
	};
};

DSI node
---------
&dsi0{
	...
	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			dsi0_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
			};
		};
	};
	...
};
