Spreadtrum Communications SC2703 Panel, WLED(Backlight) bindings

Required properties for AMOLED mode:
- compatible: should be "sprd,sc2703-bllcd"

Required properties for TFT mode:
- compatible: Same as above
- reg: I2C slave address, 0x4B.
- sprd,wled-mode: Wled operation modes,
	it is able to chosse one of below five modes.
	Whole modes can be turned on by PWM(GPIO) input
	if you don't add the 'sprd,wled-enable-by-i2c' property.
	the 'sprd,wled-enable-by-i2c' means that it is turned on by i2c access.

	1. "bypass-mode" : Controlled by external PWM(duty) directly
			based on fixed wled_idac_code_o, PWM output by input PWM.
			* The external PWM input is controlled by sc2703 wled driver.

	2. "direct-mode" : Controlled by Internal PWM or wled_idac_code_o.
			In this case, user has to fix either of them.
			Also please make sure that WLED_PWM input pin is low!

			i) Required properties in the case brightness is controlled
			   by wled_idac_code_o
				sprd,level-ctrl-by="idac-control"
				sprd,pwm-out-freq-hz = <xxxxx>;
				sprd,pwm-out-duty = <xx>;

			ii) Required properties in the case brightness is controlled
			    by pwm duty
				sprd,level-ctrl-by="pwm-control"
				sprd,pwm-out-freq-hz = <xxxxx>;
				sprd,wled-idac-microamp = <xxxx>

	3. "duty-det-pwm-mode" : Controlled by external PWM(duty) based on fixed
			wled_idac_code_o, output by internal PWM register
			* Required properties(in below Optional peoperties)
				- 'sprd,wled-idac-microamp'
				- 'pwms'
	4. "duty-det-analog-mode" : Controlled by external PWM(duty) based on fixed
			wled_idac_code_o, always high PWM(duty) output
			* Required properties(in below Optional peoperties)
				- 'sprd,wled-idac-microamp'
				- 'pwms'
	5. "duty-det-mixed-mode" : Combination of "duty-det-pwm"/"duty-det-analog"
			fix PWM_IN_DUTY_THRESHOLD(sprd,pwm-in-duty-thresh) below
			* Required properties(in below Optional peoperties)
				- 'sprd,wled-idac-microamp'
				- 'pwms'
	6. "ext-r-sink-mode" : Controlled by external PWM(duty) based on the
			VDAC_FUL_SCALE_EXT_R accordingly
			(sprd,vdac-ful-scale-ext-r) below, external R-Sink mode.
			* Required properties(in below Optional peoperties)
				- 'sprd,wled-idac-microamp'
				- 'pwms'

	For further information,
	please see the data sheet(Wled Operation Modes) further details.

Optional properties:
- sprd,wled-enable-by-i2c: wled enable by i2c access for turning on/off
			instead of GPIO control.
- sprd,lcd-enable-gpio: LCD enable by extern GPIO control instead of
			i2c access control for turning on and off.
- sprd,level-ctrl-by: In case of direct mode. user must select
			either "idac-control or "pwm-control"
			please refer above "direct mode"
- sprd,pwm-out-freq-hz : PWM out frequency for direct-mode, duty-det-pwm
			and duty-det-mixed mode.
			20000 Hz <= Range <= 34000 Hz
- sprd,pwm-out-duty : PWM out duty, range is from 0(0%) to 255(100%) for
			direct-mode, duty-det-pwm and duty-det-mixed mode.
- sprd,wled-idac-microamp : For WLED IDAC current target,
			range 160 ~ 40960 uA.
- sprd,pwm-in-duty-thresh : For duty-det-mixed mode. Range 0 ~ 255.
- sprd,max-brightness:
	To determine the max brightness when use external PWM,
	it means the mode is one of below 5 modes
	(by-pass, duty-det-pwm, duty-det-analog, duty-det-mixed mode,
	ext-r-sink)
	if set to 100, then host use the brightness range: 0 ~ 100.
	this property can be set up to 0xFFFF as maximum.
	So for the direct mode(Not external PWM mode), this will be set to
		20480 for controlling by idac-control
		255 for controlling by pwm-control
- sprd,idac-ramp-disable: WLED IDAC ramp disable
- sprd,vdac-code-microvolt: Full-scale VDAC code for WLED in ext_r_rmode,
			range from 0 to 1600000 uV
- sprd,vdac-sel-microvolt: VDAC target for WLED boost,
			range from 0 to 1600000 uV
- irq
