Spreadtrum gate clock driver.

Spreadtrum chip often uses one register to control more than one gate clock.
consumers should use index to get the correct gate clock according to asic
design documents.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "sprd,gates-clock"

- #clock-cells: must be set 1.

- sprd,gates-msk: Sprd chip gates clocks are gathering to a few registers.
		  This property should follow with the asic documents and
		  it indicates the gate index bit in register.Module user
		  should follow asic documents to get correct gate index.

- clock-output-names : The output name indicates the gates name.

Example:

	clk_mpll_gates: clk@402b00b0 {
		compatible = "sprd,gates-clock";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0 0x402b00b0 0 0x4>;
		sprd,gates-msk = <0x40004>;
		clocks = <&ext_26m>;
		clock-output-names = "clk_mpll0_gate", "clk_mpll1_gate";
	};

Here is an example about consumers how to configure the gate clock.
clk_mpll0 should use index 2 to get the clock and clk_mpll1 use index 18.
Example:

	clk_mpll0: clk@40400024 {
		compatible = "sprd,sc9850-adjustable-pll-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0x40400024 0 0x4>,
			<0 0x40400028 0 0x4>;
		clocks = <&clk_mpll_gates 2>;
		clock-output-names = "clk_mpll0";
	};

	clk_mpll1: clk@4040002c {
		compatible = "sprd,sc9850-adjustable-pll-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0x4040002c 0 0x4>,
			<0 0x40400030 0 0x4>;
		clocks = <&clk_mpll_gates 18>;
		clock-output-names = "clk_mpll1";
	};
