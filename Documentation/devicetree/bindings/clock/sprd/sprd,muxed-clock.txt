Spreadtrum multiplexed clock driver.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "sprd,muxed-clock"

- sprd,mux-msk : Mux clock has more than one parent clock. It uses a
		 register's some bits to index parent clock. This property
		 is the mask of these bits.

Example:

	clk_adi: clk@402d0028 {
		compatible = "sprd,muxed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0x402d0028 0 0x4>;     /* select reg */
		sprd,mux-msk = <0x3>;
		clocks = <&ext_26m>, <&ext_4m>, <&clk_twpll_38m4_def>,
			 <&clk_twpll_51m2_def>;
		clock-output-names = "clk_adi";
	};
