Spreadtrum composite clock driver.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "sprd,composite-clock".

- sprd,mux-msk : Composite clocks which have multiple clock sources must
		 have this property. And there must has a register which
		 contains some bits can be used to select parent. This
		 property stands for these bits' mask.

- sprd,div-msk : Composite clocks which have divider function must have
		 this property. And a register will be used for dividering
		 the source clock. This property stands for these bits' mask.

- sprd,gate-msk : Composite clocks which have gate function must have
		  this property. If having this property, there must have
		  a register can be used for gating the clock. Gating the
		  clock only need one bit. This property can used for mask
		  the gate bit.

Example:

	clk_sensor: clk@60e00024 {
		compatible = "sprd,composite-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0x60e00024 0 0x4>;
		clocks = <&ext_26m>, <&clk_twpll_48m_def>,
			 <&clk_twpll_76m8_def>, <&clk_twpll_96m_def>;
		clock-output-names = "clk_sensor";
		sprd,mux-msk = <0x3>;
		sprd,div-msk = <0x700>;
	};
