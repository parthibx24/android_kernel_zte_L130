 *
 * Architectures must provide an unsigned long page_link field in the
 * scatterlist struct. We use that to place the page pointer AND encode
 * information about the sg table as well. The two lower bits are reserved
 * for this information.
 *
 * If bit 0 is set, then the page_link contains a pointer to the next sg
 * table list. Otherwise the next entry is at sg + 1.
 *
 * If bit 1 is set, then this sg entry is the last element in a list.
 *
 * See sg_next().
