config SPRD_SIPC
	bool "Sprd IPC"
	default n
	help
	  SIPC is a module for spreadtrum AP/CP communicaiton system.

config SPRD_SIPC_MULTI_SMEM
	bool "sprd multi-smems support"
	default n
	depends on SPRD_SIPC
	help
	  Multi-SMEMs support for inter-processors data transmission.

config SPRD_SIPC_SPIPE
	bool "sprd pipe driver based on SBUF"
	default n
	depends on SPRD_SIPC
	help
	  This driver is a pipe driver base on SBUF, which create
	  general pipes between AP & CP.

config SPRD_SIPC_SPOOL
       bool "sprd pool driver based on SBLOCK"
       default n
       depends on SPRD_SIPC
       help
        This driver is a pool driver base on SBLOCK, which create
        general pools between AP & CP.

config SPRD_SIPC_SETH
       bool "Sprd Ethernet driver"
       default n
       depends on SPRD_SIPC
       help
         This driver supports the Spreadtrum Ethernet based on share
         memory. Say Y here if you want to use it.

config SPRD_SIPC_SETH_OPT
      bool "Enable performance optimization for SETH (2 Bytes reserved & US gather)"
      default n
      depends on SPRD_SIPC_SETH
      help
        Starting from SharkL, the Seth driver is optimized for data thransfer
	performance, but that is not compatible with former products
	like TShark. Enable this configuration, IF the modem end surports
	these optimizations: 2 Bytes reserved in sblock field and packets gathering
	in upstreaming direction.

config SPRD_SBLOCK_SHARE_BLOCKS
      bool "Enable all sblocks used by SETH share one block pool"
      default n
      depends on SPRD_SIPC_SETH

        Starting from SharkL4M, this optimization can reduce the
	reserved memory usage.Shall confim cp also support it.

      default n
      depends on SPRD_SIPC
      help
        Starting from SharkL5.1, use SIPX to replace SBlock or Seblock for SETH.

	default n
	depends on SPRD_SIPC_ZERO_COPY_SIPX
	help
	Enable cache from sipc memory.

config SPRD_SIPC_STTY

       help
         This driver supports the Spreadtrum Gnss SIPC driver based on share
         memory. Say Y here if you want to use it.

config SPRD_SIPC_SMSGC
       bool "Sprd message controller driver based on SMSG"
       default n
       depends on SPRD_SIPC
