	default n
	depends on OF
	help
	  This selects Hardware reset support aka pwrseq-emmc for eMMC
	  devices. By default this option is set to y.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called pwrseq_emmc.

config PWRSEQ_SIMPLE
	tristate "Simple HW reset support for MMC"
	default n
	depends on OF
	help
	  This selects simple hardware reset support aka pwrseq-simple for MMC

config MMC_EMBEDDED_SDIO
	boolean "MMC embedded SDIO device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, support will be added for embedded SDIO
	  devices which do not contain the necessary enumeration
	  support in hardware to be properly detected.

config MMC_PARANOID_SD_INIT
	bool "Enable paranoid SD card initialization (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will be extra paranoid

	  work-around for buggy controllers and hardware. Enable
	  if you are experiencing issues with SD detection.
